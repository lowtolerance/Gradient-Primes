I created this in April of 2011 in response to Alex Walker's article, "[The Cicada Principle and Why It Matters to Web Designers](http://designfestival.com/the-cicada-principle-and-why-it-matters-to-web-designers/)", which is about using prime numbers to generate interesting, non-repeating backgrounds by layering images of "prime" dimensions. 

I knew that it should be possible to achieve a similar effect using nothing but CSS3 background gradients, so I set out to prove it. It turned out to be quite easy, and this is the result of those efforts.
